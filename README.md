_[Homebrew]_ `changelog`
=======================
Following on from [Homebrew/brew#3399], this is an effort to introduce a `changelog` _[stanza]_ into Home`brew` and `cask`.

Hopefully this will follow the process of the [`desc`]ription stanza, and so initially this will be in the from of an [external command], made available with this _[tap]_…

Install
-------
~~~ sh
brew tap danielbayley/changelog
brew changelog #formula #cask
~~~

Contribute
----------
Contributions for `changelog` URLs are very welcome, and extremely easy to add; just a line of _[YAML]_ in either [`brew`.yml], or [`cask`.yml].
